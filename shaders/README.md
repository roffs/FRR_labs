# ViewerPBS

This is a skeleton viewer developed for the **Fast Realistic Rendering** course in the **Master in Research in Informatics** program at the **Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya**.

## Authors

The skeleton was created by **Imanol Munoz-Pandilella** (imanolm@cs.upc.edu), based on a previous skeleton by **Marc Comino**.

## Requirements

The skeleton is designed to be developed on **Linux** and requires the following libraries:
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io) >= 6.0.0
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

While we do not provide support for other platforms, the skeleton **should work** on **Windows** and **macOS**.
